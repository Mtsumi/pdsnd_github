#### BikeShare Application

This directory contains the BikeShare Terminal Application, which is part of the final project for the "Intro to Programming" course by Udacity.

#### Description

The BikeShare Terminal Application is a command-line program that allows users to explore bike-sharing data for three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. Users can select a city and apply filters such as month and day of the week to view statistics related to bike rides, including time statistics, station statistics, trip duration statistics, and user statistics.

#### How to Use the Application

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

2. Navigate to the "bikeshare" directory.

3. Run the `bikeshare.py` script using Python, `./bikeshare.py`. (Make sure to enable executable permissions with `chmod + x bikeshare.py` before running the file.)

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select a city and apply various filters for analysis.

5. View the statistics displayed in the terminal.
